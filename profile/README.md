# FORMAS
FORMAS Research Center on Data ans Natural Language aims to study, analyze and evaluate semantic-based approaches. Our main research areas are based on five major pillars on semantic-based area: Methods, Ontology, Information Extraction, Interoperability and Big Data. We deeply analyze each one of these approaches focusing on obtaining high levels of semantic and pragmatic comprehension. Visite our [website](http://formas.ufba.br/) for more informations.
